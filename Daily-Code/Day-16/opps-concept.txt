******************************** OOPS *******************************************
1. On DAY-15, we tried the coffee machine. If you check the code, the code was so complex.The functions 
   are so many and we are using them randomly in same place in the code make other also hard to understand.
2. Hence, we are using this concept called "OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING" (OOPS).
3. For simple understanding, Assume that you are running a hotel. In hotel there are many roles people play 
   to make job easier and simple.
   EX: - RECEPTIONIST will welcome the customers and allocate their seats to diners.
       - WAITER will take the order and forward it to CHEF
       - CHEF will prepare the food to the customer 
       -CLEANER will clean the tables, floor, utensils
       - SERVER will serve the food to them and
       - Ultimately MANAGER will manage all of them and runs the restaurant properly.

4. This is how the OOPS CONCEPTS also works. It will make or manage our program and makes things simpler and helps you
   to deal with larger and complex programs.
