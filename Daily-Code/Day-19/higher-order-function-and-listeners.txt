#LISTENRS: 
When we are giving any inputs, this LISTENERS will listen to it and perform the action.

Example:
-> How can you provide the inputs?
A. Through INPUT DEVICES like KEYBOARD, MOUSE etc..,

If you press any key or give any input. This listeners will take action according to our code.

In turtle:
tim = Turtle()
screen=Screen()


def move_forwards():
    tim.forward(10)


screen.onkey(key="space", fun=move_forwards)
#fun=move_forwards - No need to add paranthesis here, (when you are passing the function as a parameter)


#FUNCTIONS AS INPUT:
SYNTAX:

def function_a(something)
    #Do this with something
    #Then do this
    #Finally do this


def function_b():
    #Do this

function_a(function_b)

#EXAMPLE:
def add(nl, n2):
    return n1 + n2

def subtract(nl, n2):
    return nl â€” n2

def multiply(nl, n2) :
    return nl * n2

def divide(nl, n2):
    return nl / n2

def calculator(nl, n2, func):
    return func(nl, n2)

result= calculator(2,3,add)
print( result)

#THIS IS CALLED HIGHER ORDER FUNCTION
//This function is used in the inside an other function//


#INSTANCES
            Object    Class
Instance    timmy     = Turtle()
Instance    tommy     = Turtle()
