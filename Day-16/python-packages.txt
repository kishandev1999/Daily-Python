***********************PYTHON PACKAGES***********************
Till now we used the modules to use. A file create to use in code called module.
But, the package is different.
PACKAGE is nothing but a bunch of code that other people written.

EXAMPLE:
if we want to document the some pokemons and their stats in table.
In ASCII, it is very complicate to create the tables for each data.
So, we can search for package that other developers are created and we can achieve our goal.
The place where we get that is : pypi.org
#REFERENCE : https://pypi.org/

In this site, try to search "PrettyTable"
#https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/
read the description for it : "A simple Python library for easily displaying tabular data in a visually appealing ASCII table format"
If you click on homepage. It will take you the code documentation [tutorial.wiki]
