'''
IN PYTHON WE HAVE :
1. INBUILT FUNCTION
2. USER-DEFINED FUNCTION

1. IN-BUILT FUNCTIONS
EX: len(), print(), input()....etc..,

2. USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS ARE WHICH USER WILL DEFINE
IT WILL BE GIVE AS : def my_function():
#DEFINING THE FUNCTION: 
def my_function():
    #DO THIS
    #THEN DO THIS
    #FINALLY DO THIS
    
#CALLING THE FUNCTION:
my_function()
'''
#CREATING A FUNCTION
#HERE WE ARE DEFINING THE FUNCTION
def my_function():
    print("Hello")
    print("Bye")
    
#WHENEVER YOU REQUIRED TO CALL THIS FUNCTION, WE CAN CALL IT AS BELOW:
my_function()

#OUTPUT: 
#Hello
#Bye

'''
FUNCTIONS IN REAL TIME EXAMPLE:
IF YOU PROGRAMMED A ROBOT TO BY THE MILK FROM SHOP
YOU HAVE GIVE ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS AND APPLIED
ROBO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AND BRINGS YOU THE MILK
WHAT IF, YOU WANT THIS ROBOT TO BRING MILK DAILY
YOU NEED TO APPLY ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS AGAIN?
IN THIS CASE, WE USE FUNCTION. IT WILL HELP YOU TO PACKAGE ALL YOUR REPEATED COMMANDS
